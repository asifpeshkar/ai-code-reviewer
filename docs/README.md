# Docs

This folder contains placeholder screenshots for the project README. Replace these with real screenshots from your running instance.

Suggested flow:
- Start the server: `dotnet run -- --server`
- Open http://localhost:5080
- Capture full-window screenshots for:
  1) Dashboard (input + results)
  2) Issue cards (errors/warnings/info)
  3) Beautified code (expanded)
- Save as PNG files with the same names as the placeholders if you prefer raster images.

Files in this folder:
- `screenshot-dashboard.svg` – Placeholder dashboard image
- `screenshot-issues.svg` – Placeholder issue cards image
- `screenshot-beautified.svg` – Placeholder beautified code image
